You can also work with this dataset during the hands-on exercises, but feel free to try to apply these skills to your own data instead.\nSome experience with R and the tidyverse will be helpful, but the workshop will give you an overview of data analysis that will be useful even if you are not an R user, and even if you don’t want to participate in the hands-on exercises. All of the materials from the workshop (code, data, slides) will be available at this site for later review.\nFor the participants wishing to participate in the hands-on parts, you will need the following:\n\na laptop\nR version 4.0 or higher (download from r-project.org)\nan Integrated Development Environment such as the RStudio IDE but feel free to use VSCode or emacs if you prefer and know how to make R scripts or RMarkdown documents in those\nthe tidyverse add-on package version 1.3 or higher\nadd-on packages lme4 and remotes\n\nI won’t be able to provide much tech support so it is a good idea to make sure everything is installed and working before Wednesday.\nTo find out what version of R you currently have, look at the message that appears when you start R, or type R.version.string in the R console. If you need help installing R and RStudio, please check these resources kindly provided by the PsyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow.\nTo find out what version of tidyverse you have, type packageVersion(\"tidyverse\"). If you need to update tidyverse (i.e., if you have a version before 1.3), type tidyverse::update_packages() in the console and follow the instructions. You can also find more information about updating packages at the psyteachr site."
