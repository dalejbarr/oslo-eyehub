## Preparing for the workshop {.unnumbered}

We will be working through an existing dataset from a visual world eyetracking study, and writing code in R. You can also work with this dataset during the hands-on exercises, but feel free to try to apply these skills to your own data instead. 

Some experience with R and the tidyverse will be helpful, but the workshop will give you an overview of data analysis that will be useful even if you are not an R user, and even if you don't want to participate in the hands-on exercises. All of the materials from the workshop (code, data, slides) will be available at this site for later review.

But if you do want to participate in the hands-on part, please bring your own laptop with R (version 4.0 or higher) and the [tidyverse add-on package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) (version 1.3 or higher) also installed. To find out what version of R you currently have, look at the message that appears when you start R, or type `R.version.string` in the R console. If you need help installing R and RStudio, please check [these resources kindly provided by the PsyTeachR team at the University of Glasgow](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v1/installing-r.html).

It is also recommended that you have a good IDE (Integrated Development Environment) installed to help you develop R scripts. I recommend the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) but you are welcome to use other IDEs if you prefer (emacs+ESS or VSCode). I won't be able to provide much tech support so it is a good idea to make sure everything is working before Wednesday.

To find out what version of tidyverse you have, type `packageVersion("tidyverse")`. If you need to update tidyverse (i.e., if you have a version before 1.3), type `tidyverse::update_packages()` in the console and follow the instructions. You can also find more information about updating packages [at the psyteachr site](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v1/appendix-updating-r.html).
